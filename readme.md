# WilderBlog Static Generator

This is a project that I use to build my https://wildermuth.com blog. It is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) project that shows several important techniques to using the project.  Note, you can build the project and see how it works, but none of the blog stories are included in this source code (by design, to prevent stealing of material). Everything else is included here.

The site is built with several technologies including:

- @11ty/eleventy
- tailwindcss
- Vue
- TypeScript
