From there he spent a decade at NuMega Technologies, working on seminal, award-winning products like BoundsChecker and SoftIce. Next was a seven year stint at Microsoft where he worked on the Visual Studio debugger & profiler teams, Red Dog (now known as Azure), and Hyper-V. He currently works at Skytap, a cloud computing company. Along the way, he wrote several books on Windows internals, as well as numerous articles and columns for magazines just as MSJ/MSDN, PC Magazine, and Byte. When not slinging Python code or groveling through logs, Matt indulges his passion for distilled spirits and cocktails. He’s got a serious, ever growing collection of rums, and writes the CocktailWonk blog about his spirited adventures: http://cocktailwonk.com"

Now he travels the world speaking at software conferences and teaching a diverse portfolio of programming topics for corporate clients. On the consulting side he continues to work with customers like Microsoft, HP, Intel, and Intuit and enjoys being part of the Wintellect consultant group. He has over fifty hours of video training courses available in the WintellectNow, Lynda and Udemy catalogs. He writes for several publications including Code Magazine and has a new \"HLSL and Pixel Shaders for XAML Developer\" book available from O'Reilly Media. His current UI obsession revolves around the Windows 8 Metro, Mobile, ASP.NET MVC and WPF APIs.  This year he is learning as much as he can about Xamarin. You can find his blog at xamlwonderland.com. Walt is also a Microsoft MVP and author of the free Shazzam Shader Editor (shazzam-tool.com).",

On the other hand he is a mad car guy. Lars loves to get his hands dirty and maintain his fleet of classic and off-road cars. When he is not in front of a phone, laptop, desktop or other gadget, he is out in the bush getting muddy or on a car club cruise. Lars has so far published two courses with Pluralsight: Building Windows Phone Apps that Stand Out and Windows Phone Testing and Error Management. As a frequent blogger, Lars has contributed articles to the Kiandra IT Blog, Nokia’s DVLUP portal and his own blog at klint.co, often presenting arguments that are not quite main stream, but with a dash of humour and a smidgen of cheekiness. If you want to ask Lars questions, suggest blog ideas, sell a car etc., shoot him an email or follow@larsklint on twitter."
