I even had Jimmy Bogard respond:

I also made a Coding Short video that covers this same topic, if you'd rather watch than read:

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/14NGiQTioas" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
